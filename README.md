# D√©j√† Dev ‚åõ

> We&#39;ve been here before, let&#39;s save some time shall we? An opinionated generator for web projects.

## What ‚òù

Based on Lee Briggs' original [`deja-dev`](https://github.com/theleebriggs/deja-dev) tool,
the purpose of this scaffolding tool is to enable us to painlessly skip the boilerplate
and start working on the real meat of our projects as fast as possible.

Built using the [SAO](https://github.com/saojs/sao) framework.

npx sao PortableStudios/deja-dev -u my-project
